PROJECT INTRODUCTION:
    
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, there was a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. In this project, you will play detective, and put your new skills to use by building a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. To assist you in your detective work, we've combined this data with a hand-generated list of persons of interest in the fraud case, which means individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement, or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.

RESOURCES DESCRIPTION:
    
You should have python and sklearn running on your computer, as well as the starter code (both python scripts and the Enron dataset)

poi_id.py : code for the POI identifier. 

final_project_dataset.pkl : the dataset for the project. 

tester.py : run this code after poi_id.py to test the results of the identifier . 

emails_by_address : this directory contains many text files, each of which contains all the messages to or from a particular email address. It is for your reference, if you want to create more advanced features based on the details of the emails dataset.
    
To execute the project: run 
                        poi_id.py
                        tester.py
